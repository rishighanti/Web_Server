# Web_Server

Instructions: 

Running the server:
1) Include the HTML file of the website in the same directory as your Web Server Python code.
2) Run the Web Server Python code (e.g., type "python webserver.py" into a terminal)
3) Open a web browser and type "localhost:portNumber/fileName.html" in the address bar. localhost is the address of your server, portNumber is the port you have assigned to the server inside your Web server code, and fileName.html is the name of the html file that contains the website itself. Press enter, and you should see your website displayed on the web browser.
4) Repeat step 2, but this time replace "filename.html" with "otherFile.html", where "otherFile.html" is a file that does not exist in your Web server's directory. Your Web server should return a 404-error code.
